I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important."

Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. We can fix anything."
